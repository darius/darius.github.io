<b>Hi!</b>
I'm too lazy to bring back my website. But to share some old hacks:

<ul>
  <li>
    <a href="https://rawcdn.githack.com/darius/math-toys/784f612bfe4d2f24ce0d1aa5b8112d513325bc4b/sheet.html">complex numbers toy</a>

    <p>What's it for? Well, when I learned about complex numbers, they
      were explained in an abstract, algebraic way. This held for both the
      motivation and the mechanics. There was a geometric picture too, but
      it was secondary.

</ul>
