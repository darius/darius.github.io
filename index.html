<b>Hi!</b>
I'm too lazy to bring back my website. But to share some old hacks:

<ul>
  <li>
    <a href="https://raw.githack.com/darius/math-toys/master/sheet.html">complex numbers toy</a>

    <p>What's it for? Well, when I learned about complex numbers, they
      were explained in an abstract, algebraic way. This held for both the
      motivation and the mechanics. There was a geometric picture too, but
      it was secondary.
