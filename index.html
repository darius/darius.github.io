<b>Hi!</b>
I'm too lazy to bring back my website. But to share some old hacks:

    <p>What's it for? Well, when I learned about complex numbers, they
      were explained in an abstract, algebraic way. This held for both the
      motivation and the mechanics. There was a geometric picture too, but
      it was secondary.

    <p>(The UI on tablets is broken in that browser handling of touch
    events got changed in the years since. I sure had the impression
    that standard was supposed to be stable.)
