This substitutes for a personal website as long as I'm too lazy to bring back my real one.


Notes to self:

Plaintext README here instead of a README.md because it seems that
the latter would get served as the root page of the site, and I'd
rather have a bit more control of the HTML.

Bing Chat suggests these alternatives to the now-dead rawgit.com, for
serving files from my other github repos (since github will only serve
them up as plain text, apparently):
- statically
- jsDelivr
- raw.githack.com (currently using this)
- GitCDN
