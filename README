This substitutes for a personal website as long as I'm too lazy to bring back my real one.


Notes to self:

Plaintext README here instead of a README.md because it seems that
the latter would get served as the root page of the site, and I'd
rather have a bit more control of the HTML.

Bing Chat suggests these alternatives to the now-dead rawgit.com, for
serving files from my other github repos (since github will only serve
them up as plain text, apparently):
- statically
- jsDelivr
- raw.githack.com (currently using this)
- GitCDN

It also pointed out https://stackoverflow.com/questions/62601696/github-page-link-to-html-in-another-repo
which fixes this from within github.
  To publish your repo:
    Head to the repo's settings page.
    Scroll down to the Github Pages section.
    Your source must currently be set to "None". Change it to "master branch".
    Wait for some time and your site will be live at https://jason-hanser.github.io/block-schedule/
This seems like the better way to do it. Come back to this.
